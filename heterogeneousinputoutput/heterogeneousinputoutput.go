//
// The Task is executed concurrently, and once it finishes:
//   - The resulting string is sent to the ResultChan channel.
//   - The Done atomic flag is set to true, indicating completion.
//
// This allows non-blocking execution of long-running tasks while still
// providing a simple way to access the result once available.

// It returns a FutureResult that contains a ResultChan, which will receive either:
//   - the Task's actual result (if it finishes before the timeout), or
//   - the string "timeout" (if the specified duration expires first).
//
// The Done atomic flag is only set to true when the Task completes successfully;
// if the timeout occurs first, Done remains false.
//
// Internally, this function starts two goroutines:
//  1. One runs the Task in the background and sends its result to a temporary channel.
//  2. Another uses a select statement to wait for either:
//     - a message from that temporary channel, or
//     - a signal from time.After(timeout), which sends a value on its own channel after the duration.
//
// This design allows non-blocking concurrent execution with built-in timeout control.

			// Done remains false in this case

// Await blocks the caller until the Task finishes and a value
// is sent into the ResultChan. It then returns that result.
//
// This works for both Async and AsyncWithTimeout â€”
// in the timeout case, the returned value will be "timeout".

// and combines their results into a single FutureResult.
//
// It creates a new FutureResult with a buffered ResultChan large enough to hold one result
// for each of the input FutureResults.
//
// A new goroutine is started that sequentially reads one value from each input's ResultChan
// and forwards it into the combined ResultChan.
//
// The order of results in the combined channel matches the order of the input FutureResults,
// regardless of which tasks finish first.
//
// Note: This function does not start any new tasks; it only merges the results of already-running ones.
