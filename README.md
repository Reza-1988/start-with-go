## Start With Go

This repository contains my personal Go (Golang) practice projects and exercises  
from the **Quera Jump Backend Collage**.  
Each folder represents a standalone Go module that focuses on a different topic or concept.

---

### About the Repository

This repo is part of my learning journey with **Go language** and **backend development**.  
All exercises are based on problems provided in the *Quera Jump Backend course*,  
and all solutions are implemented by me.

> ðŸ§© **Note:**  
> All problem statements belong to Quera.  
> The code and implementations in this repository are my own work.

### Project Structure

Each directory in this repository represents an **independent Go module**.  
Every module contains its own `go.mod` and `go.sum` files,  
which means it can be **built, tested, and maintained separately**.  
This structure follows Goâ€™s best practices for organizing multiple small projects  
within a single monorepo.
